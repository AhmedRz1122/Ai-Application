# ThunderAI
A deep learning model for Image Classification is used for making an ai application with the following tools for frontend and backend:<br> 
1-React <br>
2-Tailwind.css<br>3-Flask <br>
4-Shadcn_ui<br>
This Application used the Resnet-18 model with the CIFAR-100 dataset which classifies the image based on 100 different classes.

On the other hand, there are image generation and text generation features added to the project which use the meta ai API for generating images and text-based prompts.
