A deep learning model(Image Classification) application made by using React, Tailwind.css, and Flask. This Application contains the Restnet-18 model with the CIFAR-100 dataset which classifies the image-based classes.

On the other hand, there are image generation and text generation features added to the project which use the meta API for generating the images and text-based prompts.
